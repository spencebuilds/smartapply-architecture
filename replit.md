# Overview

An automated job application system that monitors job postings from multiple sources (Lever and Greenhouse APIs), matches them against predefined resume profiles using keyword analysis, and sends notifications through Slack. The system stores matched jobs in Airtable for tracking and runs continuously with configurable scheduling intervals.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
