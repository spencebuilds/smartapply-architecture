# Comprehensive System Overview - Job Application System with ML Learning

**Last Updated:** August 18, 2025  
**Status:** Fully Operational with Machine Learning Capabilities

## System Architecture Overview

This is an advanced Python-powered automated job application system that uses intelligent semantic vocabulary learning to optimize job search strategies. The system bridges vocabulary gaps between job descriptions and resume experience using a machine learning database.

### Core Innovation
- **Semantic Vocabulary Learning**: The system learns associations between different vocabularies (job terms vs resume terms) to accurately assess resume strength
- **No Hallucination**: All resume customizations are based on learned vocabulary mappings, not generated content
- **Continuous Learning**: Each application teaches the system better vocabulary bridging

## Technology Stack

### Backend (Python 3.11)
- **Flask**: Slack Events API server (port 5000)
- **Threading**: Background job scheduling and processing
- **Requests**: HTTP client for API communications

### Databases
- **Supabase PostgreSQL**: Primary ML learning database (11 tables)
- **Airtable**: User-friendly tracking and manual management
- **Local JSON**: Deduplication and processed job tracking

## Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. Job Processing Pipeline
1. **Fetch Jobs**: Lever + Greenhouse APIs → Raw job data
2. **Extract Concepts**: ConceptExtractor finds learned vocabulary mappings
3. **Match Analysis**: Both keyword + concept matching with confidence scores
4. **Store Analysis**: Job posting + role analysis stored in Supabase
5. **Send Notifications**: Qualified jobs sent to Slack with match details

### 2. Learning Pipeline (Slack Reactions)
1. **User Reaction**: ✅ on Slack job notification
2. **Application Logging**: Stored in both Airtable + Supabase
3. **Concept Learning**: System identifies which concept mappings led to successful application
4. **Translation Events**: Records successful vocabulary bridging events
5. **Model Update**: Confidence scores and success counts updated

### 3. Vocabulary Bridging Example
- **Job Description**: "Looking for a PM with API experience"
- **Learned Mappings**: "PM" → "Product Management" (0.8 confidence), "API experience" → "API Development" (0.9 confidence)
- **Resume Matching**: System knows user has "Product Management" and "API Development" experience
- **Result**: High-confidence match despite vocabulary differences
